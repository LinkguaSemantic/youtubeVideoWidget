    <p>Taylor Swift just took on a whole new look courtesy of Vogue and her blonde locks have never been brighter. But why did Taylor Swift dye her hair platinum blonde in the first place? Turns out, the Vogue queen of fashion herself had something to do with it.</p>

    <p>According to Fashionista, Anna Wintour, Vogue's iconic editor-in-chief, spilled the details on crafting a new look for sweet Swifty to the magazine's podcast. Wintour told podcast host Andre Leon Talley, "We thought that we could take Taylor — who is a beautiful, beautiful girl but has been a little bit more conservative in her fashion choices — and turn her into an Hedi Slimane rock n' roll girl." Considering the edgy blonde locks reminiscent of early punk girls, Wintour clearly succeeded!</p>

    <p>As for how Swift responded, Wintour claimed, "She was completely up for it and loved it, and is going to hopefully continue with this look." And, given how rocker chic Swift looked at Coachella, she's clearing taking Wintour's style advice to heart.</p>

    <p>In case you haven't hit up the singer's Instagram lately, it's currently full of new pics showing some seriously fierce attitude. Swift seems pretty pumped on her platinum and I'll be curious to see how long it lasts.</p>
